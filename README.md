The binary_to_image_conversion folder contains code that can be used to represent APK files as images.

M1gray, M2gray, M3gray and M2color are techniques mentioned in C. Jaju, D. Agrawal, R. Poddar, S. Badjate, S. Anand, B. Mitra, and S. Dey, "Analyzing Image Based Strategies for Android Malware Detection and Classification: An Empirical Exploration," in 20th International Conference on Security and Cryptography (SECRYPT), Rome, Italy, July 2023, pp. 863-869.

These techniques were implemented to familiarize myself with the concept of converting binaries to images.
The files named Markov were used to genenrate Markov images which are used in the Lightweight CNN.


The Lightweight CNN folder contains code for for the Lightweight CNN mentioned in B. Yuan, J. Wang, P. Wu, and X. Qing, "IoT Malware Classification Based on Lightweight Convolutional Neural Networks," in IEEE Internet of Things Journal, vol. 9, no. 5, pp. 3770-3783, March 1, 2022, doi: 10.1109/JIOT.2021.3100063.
The networks in this folder differ in the number of channels in the input image.
